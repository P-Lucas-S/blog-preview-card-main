## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me improve my skills in creating responsive layouts using Flexbox. I learned how to effectively use Flexbox properties to center elements and create a responsive design that adapts well to different screen sizes.

Here's an example of a Flexbox container I am proud of:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  background: #F4D04E;
  font-family: 'Figtree', sans-serif;
  font-size: 17px;
  font-weight: 500;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on responsive design, ensuring that my layouts look good on all devices. Additionally, I plan to explore CSS Grid to see how it compares to Flexbox for creating complex layouts.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout) - This helped me understand Flexbox better and apply it effectively in my project.
- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide was very useful for understanding the various properties of Flexbox and how to use them.
